This script will clean up your computer for temporary files and also clear your Recycle Bin to free up space. If at any point you wish to stop it, simply move the mouse cursor to the top left corner of your screen and wait until it terminates. Alternatively, you can close the command prompt window where this message is printed. Cheers!
